		Prevents friendly mechanoids from wandering around when idle - they instead go to any available charging stations or go dormant (mod respects max charge levels from mech groups)
		
		Only applies to bots set to "work" order from their mech group, escort bots and bots already set to charge or dormancy will be unaffected. 
		
		Also does not appy to militors as their wandering seems more thematically appropriate.
